## Model Descriptions

**iFermCell215**

iFermCell215 is a unicellular metabolic model with 156 reactions. This model contains pathways for fermentation pathways, including reverse b-oxidation, and is able to use several substrates. It contains three compartments: cytoplasm (c), extracellular space (e), and a compartment for generation of ion-motive force (i). 

**iFermGuilds789**

iFermGuids789 is a community metabolic model with 564 reactions distributed among six functional guilds. The six guilds each contain subsets of reactions obtained in iFermCell215. The guilds are  simple sugar fermenters that produce acetate, lactate, and ethanol (SFOs), sugar fermenters that are able to generate ferredoxin and hydrogen gas (HSFs), organisms that perform reverse b-oxidation on intermediates derived from sugars (SEOs), lactate-consumers that perform reverse b-oxidation (LEOs), and organisms that produce acetate from hydrogen gas and CO2 (HAOs).

***Please note that model flux results in both models have have multiple units. For intracellular reactions, the fluxes have standard units of mmol gDCW<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>. For exchange reactions, the units are mmol hr<sup>-1</sup> because they are multipled by the mass of biomass related to each guild.***

## Getting started

**For those new to metabolic modeling**

It is highly recommended to read the docs for [CobraPy](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get started with metabolic modeling in python and try some of their exampel models before using the fermentation models.  

**Constraining the reactor environment**

In the model, see **Part I: REACTOR PARAMETERS**

Here, you can tell the model if it should consider transport energetics related to extracellular concentrations of end-products. You can also set the temperature, the biomass concentration (volatile suspended solids, VSS) concentraion, the intracellular and extracellular pH, and the concentrations of products inside and outside the cell. To ignore transport energetics, you can simply set ```TransEnergetics = False```. If you are not interested in modeling a bioreactor, and are interested in flux distributions, you can just set the volume and VSS concentrationeach to ```1``` which will result in all reported fluxes being in units of mmol gDCW<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>  

**Building the metabolic networks**

In the model, see **Part II: BUILDING THE MODEL**

Most of the code in the models adds reactions and metabolites to build the metabolic networks. For example, the following code adds the ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase reaction to the model:

```
#ru5p__D_c <-> xu5p__D_c

xu5p__D_c = Metabolite('xu5p__D_c', formula='C5H9O8P', name='D-Xylulose 5-phosphate', compartment='c', charge=-2)
ru5p__D_c = Metabolite('ru5p__D_c', formula='C5H9O8P', name='D-Ribulose 5-phosphate', compartment='c', charge=-2)

reaction = Reaction('RPE')
reaction.name = 'Ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase'
reaction.subsystem = 'Pentose Utilization'
reaction.lower_bound = -1000.  # This is the default
reaction.upper_bound = 1000.  # This is the default

reaction.add_metabolites({ru5p__D_c: -1.0,
                          xu5p__D_c: 1.0})


model.add_reactions([reaction])

print(reaction.name + ": " + str(reaction.check_mass_balance()))
```

We first add the two metabolites, D-xylulose 5-phosphate and D-Ribulose 5-phosphate. Then, we add the reaction based on it's ID (which, when possible matches the reaction ID from the BIGG Database (http://bigg.ucsd.edu). The reaction bounds indicate whether the default reaction is reversible or not. We can change reversibility later if we want. We then set the reaction stoihciometry, in this case consuming 1 ru5p_c and producing 1 xu5p_c. We then add the reaction to the model using ```model.add_reactions([reaction])```. Lastly, we check the mass balance and print it to the model output. 

**Feeding the model**

In the model, see **Part III: SUBSTRATE UPTAKE**

To set substrate uptake, in mmol/hr, set the "medium" value to the desired uptake rate. This is the maximum uptake rate, so if you specify multiple medium componenents, one may be limiting. For all exchange metabolites that you do not want to test,set the value to 0. This will ensure the model does not consume these compounds, but it still allows the model to produce these compounds.  As an example, to test co-utilization of xylose and hydrogen gas with xylose being the limiting substrate, I could set the media constraints as follows:

```
medium = model.medium

medium["EX_xyl__D_e"] = 1 
medium["EX_xyl4_e"] = 0
medium["EX_glc4_e"] = 0
medium["EX_glc__D_e"] = 0
medium["EX_glyc_e"] = 0
medium["EX_lac__D_e"] = 0 
medium["EX_etoh_e"] = 0
medium["EX_ac_e"] = 0
medium["EX_but_e"] = 0
medium["EX_hxa_e"] = 0
medium["EX_h2_e"] = 1000
medium["EX_octa_e"] = 0
medium["EX_ppa_e"] = 0
medium["EX_pta_e"] = 0
medium["EX_hpta_e"] = 0
medium["EX_co2_e"] = 0
medium["EX_for_e"] = 0

model.medium = medium

```

**Setting reaction constraints**

In the model, see **PART IV: SET ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS**

To turn off end-products, use the ```.knockout()``` function from CobraPy to turnoff exhcange reactions. If we wanted to prevent the model from producing formate, for instance, we could use the following:

```
#Turn off end products
model.reactions.EX_for.knock_out()
```

To turn off a reaction, use the ```.knockout()``` function from CobraPy. As an example, if we want to turn of Coenzyme A Transferase for all products from 4-8 carbons in length, we could use the following:

```
#Turn off CoaT
model.reactions.CoATC4.knock_out()
model.reactions.CoATC6.knock_out()
model.reactions.CoATC8.knock_out()
model.reactions.CoATC5.knock_out()
model.reactions.CoATC7.knock_out()
```

To change the reversibility of a reaction, we can set the reaction bounds to override the default reversibility. For example, if we want to make acetate kinase irreversible, we could use:

```#model.reactions.ACKr.lower_bound = 0```


**Constraining "growth rates"**

When using the community metabolic model, we may want to constrain growth rates of functional guilds. For instance, we may want all guilds to have the same growth rate to model a continously-fed reactor. To do this, we add custom model constraints using CobraPy. To constrain SEOs, SFOs, LEOs, and HSFs to have the same growth rate we can use the following:

```
#Set growth rate for each guild to be equal
#Please note that Including a guild not included in the model will result in an error!

if SEO_Abnd > 0 and SFO_Abnd > 0 and HSF_Abnd > 0 and LEO_Abnd > 0:
    Constraint_abundance1 = model.problem.Constraint(model.reactions.SEO_BIOMASS.flux_expression  - model.reactions.SFO_BIOMASS.flux_expression, lb=0, ub=0)
    model.add_cons_vars(Constraint_abundance1)

    Constraint_abundance2 = model.problem.Constraint(model.reactions.SFO_BIOMASS.flux_expression  - model.reactions.HSF_BIOMASS.flux_expression, lb=0, ub=0)
    model.add_cons_vars(Constraint_abundance2)

    Constraint_abundance_3 = model.problem.Constraint(model.reactions.HSF_BIOMASS.flux_expression  - model.reactions.LEO_BIOMASS.flux_expression, lb=0, ub=0)
    model.add_cons_vars(Constraint_abundance_3)

```

**Setting the objective function**

In the model, see **PART V: Setting the objective function**.

To set the objective function to maximize biomass growth, use the built in function from CobraPy:

***For iFermCell215:***

In this case, we are setting the objective function to the ATP hydrolysis step. 

```
model.objective = 'BIOMASS'
```

***For iFermGuilds789:***

To set the objective function to maximize biomass growth in iFermGuilds789, use:
```
model.objective = 'EX_BIOMASS_COMM_e'
```

Additional objective functions, such as maximizing octanoate production, can also be used. 

**Running the model**

***pFBA:***

Parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA) finds a set of fluxes that maximizes the objective function while minimizing the sum of fluxes through the model. The results of pFBA is a single flux for each reaction in the model. 

To run pFBA and print the results use:

```
pfba_solution = cobra.flux_analysis.pfba(model)
model.summary()
print (pfba_solution.fluxes)
```

***FVA:***

Flux variability analysis provides a range of fluxes through each reaction that can maintain the maximum objective function flux (or some percentage of the maximum objective function flux). The results of FVA are a minimum and maximum flux for each reaction. 

To run FVA and print the results use:

```
fva = flux_variability_analysis(model, loopless=True, fraction_of_optimum=1)
print (fva)
```

***Flux Sampling:***


**Model outputs**

The python code will write results to excel files.

To create an output file (output.xlsx) of each reaction with its pFBA flux value, use:

```
writer = pandas.ExcelWriter('output_FBA.xlsx')
pfba_solution.fluxes.to_excel(writer,'Sheet1')
writer.save()
```

To write the FVA results to excel (output_FVA.xlsx), use:

```
writer = pandas.ExcelWriter('output_FVA.xlsx')
fva.to_excel(writer,'Sheet1')
writer.save()
```

To write the flux sampling results to excel, use:

```
s = sample(model, 100, seed = 519)
writer = pandas.ExcelWriter('output_FluxSampling.xlsx')
s.to_excel(writer, 'Sheet1')
writer.save()
```

## Exporting models for use in Matlab

To convert the model to a form that can be used in the Matlab distribution of COBRA, convert the model to SBML format using:

```cobra.io.write_sbml_model(model, "model.xml")```
